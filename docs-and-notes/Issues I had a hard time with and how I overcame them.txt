#Issue 1 - After adding DockerCompose project to the solution and adjusting docker-compose.yml and docker-compose.override.yml files, I set the solution to use Docker Compose and hit F5
to see if everything was working properly.
When I tried to get data from data source, there was db-related timeout problem.
In that moment, a set of db-connection-related parameters was missing in the appsettings.Development.json file and the ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT environment variable was set to Development.
The app automatically defaults to the sets of parameters located in the appsettings.json file. Although, the connection string was pointing to localhost:
...,
"DatabaseSettings": {
    "DatabaseName": "CatalogDb",
    "CollectionName": "Products",
    "ConnectionString": "mongodb://LOCALHOST:27017" <<<<<<<<<<<
}
  
When running in the composition, the connection string must point to CATALOGDB, actually (see container_name located at docker-compose.override.yml file).
To overcome this problem, the following set of parameters was added to appsettings.Deveopment.json file:

...,
"DatabaseSettings": {
    "DatabaseName": "CatalogDb",
    "CollectionName": "Products",
    "ConnectionString": "mongodb://CATALOGDB:27017"
}

..and voi la!
